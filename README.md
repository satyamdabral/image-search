    Sure, let's break down the `searchImages` and `createImageWrapper` functions in simpler terms:

createImageWrapper Function

1. This function is like a designer who creates a nice frame for a picture.

2. It adds some decorations to the frame to make it look nice (like adding a special class for styling).

3. It puts a picture and a description inside the frame (the picture and its information).
